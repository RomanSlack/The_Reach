Can you describe the art style and do some research on how they made it for the game supreme commander reforged please, like how the textures art direction shadows lighting all looks

Based on the image provided, you are looking at Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance (or the original Supreme Commander). It is worth noting that while there isn't an official game called "Supreme Commander Reforged," you are likely thinking of the Forged Alliance Forever (FAF) community project, which keeps the game alive with updated shaders, textures, and lighting that give it a "reforged" look.

Here is a breakdown of the art style and the technical research on how Gas Powered Games (and the community) achieved this look.

1. The Art Style: "Scale over Detail"
The defining characteristic of Supreme Commander’s art direction is readability at infinite scale. The game was designed around the "Strategic Zoom" feature, meaning the art had to look good from 10 feet away and 10 kilometers up.

Utilitarian & Faction-Specific: Because you view units from far away, the art team relied on distinct silhouettes rather than tiny details to distinguish factions.

UEF (United Earth Federation): Blocky, industrial, utilitarian, tank-treads. Textures are matte camo and heavy metals.

Cybran Nation (seen in your image): Angular, insectoid, sharp edges. The "Spider Bot" (Megalith) in your image is the prime example—lots of red glowing lights and jagged, stealth-fighter geometry.

Aeon Illuminate: Smooth, flowing curves, floating units, white and gold ceramics.

Seraphim: Asymmetrical, ethereal, organic alien shapes.

Ballistic Visuals: Unlike other RTS games where lasers instantly hit (hitscan), SupCom simulates every projectile. The art style emphasizes tracers, smoke trails, and firing arcs so you can visually track the flow of battle from a zoomed-out view.

2. How They Made It (Technical Research)
The game runs on the Moho Engine, custom-built by Gas Powered Games (Chris Taylor’s team) specifically to handle this "Zoom from a single unit to the whole planet" mechanic. Here is how they pulled it off:

A. The LOD (Level of Detail) & Imposter System
This is the "secret sauce" of Supreme Commander.

The Problem: Rendering 1,000 units at full detail would melt any computer (especially in 2007).

The Solution: They used an aggressive 3-stage visual system.

Close Range: You see the full 3D model with high-res textures and normal maps.

Mid Range: The game swaps the model for a "Low Poly" version with simplified geometry.

Far Range (Imposters): This is the genius part. When you zoom out, the 3D units are replaced by 2D sprites (billboards) that always face the camera. These are pre-rendered images of the units.

Strategic View: Finally, at max zoom, they turn into Strategic Icons (the little geometric shapes).

Effect: This allows the engine to render massive armies without processing millions of polygons.

B. Texture Splatting & Normal Mapping
Terrain: The ground isn't just one big texture. They used Texture Splatting, where they layer multiple textures (sand, rock, grass) and blend them using an "alpha map" to create natural transitions without hard edges.

Normal Maps: To make the flat surfaces of the tanks look detailed, they relied heavily on "Normal Maps" (blue/purple textures that tell the light how to bounce). This makes a flat grey polygon look like it has bolts, vents, and panels without actually adding extra 3D geometry.

C. Lighting (Spherical Harmonics)
The lighting in your image (the bright laser beam and the shadows) uses a technique called Light Space Perspective Shadow Maps (LiSPSM). This concentrates shadow resolution near the camera, so shadows look crisp close up but get blurry far away (where you can't see them anyway).

They also used Spherical Harmonic Lighting for the ambient light, which allowed units to look grounded in the environment (e.g., reflecting the green of the grass on their undersides).

D. The "Reforged" Look (FAF Community Updates)
If you are playing via Forged Alliance Forever (FAF), the community has actually patched the rendering engine.

New Shaders: They added better water reflections and sharper shadows.

Texture Upscaling: Some modders use AI upscaling to sharpen the original 2007 textures for 4K monitors.

Lighting Fixes: They fixed bugs in the original engine that caused lighting to look flat on certain maps.

One Next Step: If you want to see exactly how the "Imposter" system works, I can guide you on how to activate the debug view in the game, which turns on wireframes so you can see the exact moment the 3D models swap to 2D sprites. Would you like to know the console command for that?

Ok but i also mean describing like how the lighting looks how shadows look that vibe

You are absolutely right to focus on the "vibe" because that is what makes Supreme Commander feel so distinct from other RTS games. It doesn't look "painterly" like Warcraft or "gritty" like Company of Heroes.

The vibe of the lighting and shadows in this image (and the "Reforged"/FAF version of the game) is best described as "High-Contrast Industrial Realism."

Here is a breakdown of that specific look:

1. The Lighting Vibe: "Harsh Sunlight"
The lighting in this game is not soft or ambient; it is designed to mimic harsh, direct sunlight hitting metal.

The "Specular" Pop: Notice the white highlights on the edges of the red spider bot (the Megalith). This is "Specular Lighting." It makes the units look like they are made of cold, hard metal rather than plastic. In the "Reforged" updates, they cranked this up so units glimmer as they move.

The Laser Bloom: See that red beam firing? It has a "Bloom" effect—a soft glow that bleeds into the surrounding air. The art direction relies on neon-on-matte contrast: the terrain is dull and matte (earthy greens/browns) so that the neon lasers (red for Cybran, blue for UEF) scream "danger" when they fire.

Atmospheric Haze: If you look at the top left of your image (the distant base), it’s slightly faded. This is Distance Fog. It tricks your brain into feeling the massive scale. It says, "That base isn't just small; it's 5 miles away."

2. The Shadow Vibe: "Grounding the Scale"
Shadows in Supreme Commander serve a specific artistic purpose: Weight.

Pitch Black & Hard Edged: Unlike modern games that use "soft shadows" (where the edges blur), SupCom uses relatively sharp, dark shadows. Look under the spider bot's legs. The shadows are almost pitch black. This creates a "high noon" vibe, making the units feel heavy and firmly planted on the ground.

The "Colossus" Effect: The art team deliberately made the shadows of Experimental units (like your spider bot) enormous. When a unit casts a shadow that covers entire trees, your brain instantly registers it as "Godzilla-sized."

3. The "Reforged" Texture Direction
Since you mentioned the "Reforged" look (likely the Forged Alliance Forever community graphics updates), here is what they changed to get that specific texture look:

Normal Mapping (The "Fake 3D" Look): If you look at the legs of the spider bot, you see panels, vents, and grooves. Those aren't actually 3D shapes; they are flat textures using a "Normal Map"—a special trick that tells the lighting engine "pretend there is a bump here." The Reforged shaders make these bumps catch the light more aggressively, giving the units a rugged, complex surface texture.

Terrain Blending: The ground uses "Texture Splatting." Instead of one boring green tile, they layer distinct textures—dirt, scorch marks, grass, and rock—and blend them. The "vibe" result is that the battlefield looks scarred and lived-in, not just a pristine chessboard.

Summary of the Aesthetic
If you were to describe this art style to a concept artist, you would say:

"I want utilitarian sci-fi. No magic, no cartoons. The lighting should feel like a bright, clear day with hard, punishing sunlight. The metal should look cold and shiny, the lasers should bloom against the ground, and the shadows should be deep black to give the units massive weight."


To recreate that specific *Supreme Commander* "vibe" in **Babylon.js** without needing to build a custom engine from scratch, you need to replicate the specific artistic shortcuts Gas Powered Games used.

The Moho engine prioritized scale and "readability at a distance." In Babylon.js, you can achieve this by combining **Terrain Splatting**, **Cascaded Shadows**, and **PBR Materials**.

Here is your technical roadmap to getting that look.

### 1. The Terrain: "Texture Splatting" (The SupCom Ground Look)

*SupCom* terrain looks good because it isn't one giant blurry texture; it's 3 or 4 high-detail textures (sand, rock, grass) blended together using a "Splat Map."

* **Babylon Tool:** `BABYLON.TerrainMaterial` (You need the Babylon Materials Library extension).
* **How to do it:**
* **The Mix Map:** Create an RGB image where Red = Sand, Green = Grass, Blue = Rock.
* **The Code Vibe:**


```javascript
// This allows you to paint high-res textures onto a massive ground mesh
var terrainMaterial = new BABYLON.TerrainMaterial("terrain", scene);
terrainMaterial.mixTexture = new BABYLON.Texture("textures/splatMap_RGB.png", scene);

// Diffuse (Color) + Bump (Normal) for each layer
terrainMaterial.diffuseTexture1 = new BABYLON.Texture("textures/sand.jpg", scene);
terrainMaterial.bumpTexture1 = new BABYLON.Texture("textures/sand_n.jpg", scene); // Critical for the "rugged" look

terrainMaterial.diffuseTexture2 = new BABYLON.Texture("textures/grass.jpg", scene);
terrainMaterial.bumpTexture2 = new BABYLON.Texture("textures/grass_n.jpg", scene);

```


* **Art Direction Note:** Keep the terrain matte (not shiny). This provides the necessary contrast for your shiny metallic units.

### 2. The Lighting: "Cascaded Shadow Maps" (CSM)

Standard shadows look blocky when you zoom out to a "strategic view." *SupCom* fixed this by changing shadow resolution based on distance.

* **Babylon Tool:** `CascadedShadowGenerator`
* **The Look:** This creates the "High Noon" harsh shadow look. It calculates crisp shadows near the camera and simpler ones far away.
* **How to do it:**
```javascript
// Create the "Sun" - High intensity, white color
var sun = new BABYLON.DirectionalLight("sun", new BABYLON.Vector3(-1, -2, -1), scene);
sun.intensity = 2.5; // SupCom is BRIGHT

// Enable Cascaded Shadows (The secret sauce for large scale)
var csm = new BABYLON.CascadedShadowGenerator(1024, sun);
csm.lambda = 0.5; // Blends the transition between sharp and soft shadows
csm.darkness = 0.3; // SupCom shadows are dark, but not Vantablack

```



### 3. The Units: PBR for the "Cold Metal" Vibe

The units in your image pop because they have high "Specular" highlights (shiny edges).

* **Babylon Tool:** `BABYLON.PBRMaterial`
* **The Recipe:** You want a material that looks like painted heavy metal.
* **Settings:**
* `metallic`: **0.8 - 1.0** (It is metal, after all).
* `roughness`: **0.3 - 0.4** (Smooth enough to shine, but scuffed enough to look used).
* `albedoColor`: Dark greys, deep reds (Cybran), or navy blues (UEF).


* **The "Bloom" Trick:** To get the glowing lasers or engines, use the `emissiveColor` property on specific parts of the mesh and pair it with a Glow Layer (see below).

### 4. The Camera: "Strategic Zoom"

To get the feel of the controls, you need a camera that pivots but limits how low it can go.

* **Babylon Tool:** `ArcRotateCamera`
* **Setup:**
```javascript
var camera = new BABYLON.ArcRotateCamera("Camera", 0, 0, 10, BABYLON.Vector3.Zero(), scene);

// Limits prevent the user from clipping through the floor or looking up at the sky
camera.lowerBetaLimit = 0.1;
camera.upperBetaLimit = Math.PI / 2.2;

// "Zoom to Mouse" is critical for RTS feel
camera.useInputToZoomOnPointerLocation = true;

// Scale controls (Zoom out to 1000 units, in to 10)
camera.lowerRadiusLimit = 10;
camera.upperRadiusLimit = 1000;

```



### 5. Post-Processing: The "Reforged" Vibe

This is what makes the game look modern rather than flat.

* **Babylon Tool:** `DefaultRenderingPipeline`
* **The Checklist:**
1. **Glow Layer (Bloom):** Essential for lasers and unit lights.
2. **Tone Mapping:** Use `ACES` tone mapping to simulate that harsh, realistic sunlight contrast.
3. **Fog:** Add a `scene.fogMode = BABYLON.Scene.FOGMODE_EXP2` with a color matching your skybox to blend the distant horizon.



### Summary Checklist for the Look

| Feature | SupCom Vibe | Babylon.js Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Ground** | Detailed sand/rock blending | `TerrainMaterial` with MixMap |
| **Shadows** | Crisp at all distances | `CascadedShadowGenerator` |
| **Metal** | Shiny, cold, scuffed | `PBRMaterial` (High Metal, Med Roughness) |
| **Scale** | Infinite view | `ArcRotateCamera` + `scene.fog` |
| **Glow** | Neon lasers / engines | `Pipeline.glowLayerEnabled = true` |

**Would you like me to generate a simple HTML/JS file that sets up this exact "Terrain + CSM + PBR" scene so you can paste it into the Babylon Playground to test?**
